## üöÄ Overview

This project aims to perform **real-time stock market analysis** using various **AWS services**. By integrating **Kafka**, **S3**, **AWS Crawler**, **Glue Data Catalog**, and **Athena**, the project facilitates efficient data streaming, processing, and querying for stock market data at scale. It allows you to analyze live stock market data streams, store the data in **S3** for future use, and use **AWS Crawler** for automatically discovering and cataloging the data, making it easier to query and analyze stock data in real time.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time stock market data collection** using **Kafka** for streaming data ingestion.
- **AWS S3** for scalable storage of raw and processed stock market data.
- **AWS Crawler** for data discovery and automatic cataloging in the **Glue Data Catalog**.
- **Glue Data Catalog** to maintain a catalog of stock data for easier querying and metadata management.
- **AWS Athena** for querying the stock data directly from **S3** using SQL without the need for data movement.
- Scalable and serverless architecture for processing large volumes of stock data.
